### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational modeling of magnetorheological elastomers for my PhD in Physics, using Python, Cython, CuPy (CUDA)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as I go, and hoping to do (more) semi-formal coursework in computer science on my own
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with becoming an effective software engineer (and collaborator) and doing multidisciplinary scientific computing
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about learning and working independently
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dmarchfi@colostate.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also have a degree in Biological Sciences. I pursued physics in part because of the questions I had about protein behavior and synthesis, as well as supportive undergraduate professors and research advisors
